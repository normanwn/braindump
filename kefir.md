# Kefir - HOWTO

## Quick start:
1. These grains are already active and were added to fresh whole organic milk this morning at 7:00 am.  I generally swap the kefir grains out with fresh milk about every 48 hours, though you can swap as early as 12 hours depending on your desired taste and consistency.  Generally speaking, a longer ferment will provide a more sour taste and thicker more yogurt like consistency.  Everything I have read says don't go past 48 hours, though I have had to a couple of times and nothing bad has happened.  Your mileage may vary.
2. Place the jar (you may want to swap to something bigger) on a counter out of the sun, with the metal top off, and covered by the provided coffee filter secured with something like a rubber band.  This lets the kefir breathe and keeps any pests out.
3. Wait...
4. Once the kefir has reached the desired consistency use a fine strainer (plastic is preferred, but I have been using a metal one with no adverse affects) to separate the grains from the kefir using a plastic or metal spoon you may need to push the milk through the strainer.  Just being careful not to mash the grains through.  They should stand out from the rest of the batch being somewhat translucent and rubbery.  Most of mine have been clumped together, but you may get some single ones from time to time.
5. Place the grains off to one side in a bowl, and put your kefir in a glass container with a lid in the refrigerator.  I generally mark mine with a date and try to use it within the next 2 weeks.
6. Place the grains back in a clean jar with a quarter cup of finished kefir and about 2 cups of milk.  You can probably produce more with a bit more grains but you'll have to experiment.

### Notes
* I have been using organic whole milk as of late, you can also use 2%, it will be a looser consistency, and may start separating when the ferment is complete (that's okay).  
* Lately, my kefir has just been jell-o like (which is okay too), during the winter it separated out to curds and whey.  Don't fret, just mix it back together with a spoon before straining off the grains. You could alternately let it keep going (may take more than 48 hrs) until it completely separates and strain off the whey and pull out the grains with a spoon then with cheese cloth let it drain into a bowl in the refrigerator for kefir cheese (use it like cream cheese).
* You can also make a sour cream with it by adding equal parts whole milk and half and half using the same process as above.
* You can drink the kefir straight, or add some chocolate syrup, strawberry jam, or maple syrup to taste.
* Use the kefir in place of buttermilk or yogurt in recipes for delicious pancakes, cornbread, or ranch dressing.
* I have heard you can use goat's milk with kefir but I have yet to try this. YMMV.
* There are lots of other things folks are doing online, good luck and happy kefiring!
